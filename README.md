# LispInJava
Sample project on how to integrate Common Lisp in Java.

# Background
Very simple project on integrating Common Lisp scripting in Java.

Java by default, incorporate Nashorn Java Script Engine in JDK 8, unfortunately, it has been removed on later versions. I was wondering if it is possible to integrate some exoteric language to Java such as Lisp.

Of course, it is possible using [ABCL](https://abcl.org/), it was a nice exercise to do.
